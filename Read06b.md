## CSS Properties Affect How Elements Are Displayed:


CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two
parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify
several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.

> **syntax:** &nbsp;&nbsp; Property :Value;

##### **Properties**
 indicate the aspects
of the element you want to
change. 

##### **Values**
 specify the settings
you want to use for the chosen
properties.

 ## Selectors:

 - Universal Selector
 
 > Applies to all elements in the
document

- Type Selector
> Matches element names

- Class Selector
> Matches an element whose
class attribute has a value that
matches the one specified after
the period (or full stop) symbol

- ID Selector
> Matches an element whose
id attribute has a value that
matches the one specified after
the pound or hash symbol

- Child Selector
> Matches an element that is a
direct child of another

- Descendant Selector
> Matches an element that is a
descendent of another specified
element (not just a direct child of
that element)

- Adjacent Sibling
Selector
> Matches an element that is the
next sibling of another

- General Sibling
Selector

> Matches an element that is a
sibling of another, although it
does not have to be the directly
preceding element


## Summary

- X CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside
its own box and uses rules to indicate how that
element should look.

- X Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the
elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that
indicate what these elements should look like).

- X Different types of selectors allow you to target your
rules at different elements.

- X Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties
of the element that you want to change, and the values
of those properties. For example, the font-family
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial
specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.

- X CSS rules usually appear in a separate document,
although they may appear within an HTML page.
