# Loops & Expressions 

## what is loops?
 loop is a programming structure that repeats a sequence of instructions  until a specific condition is met. Loops check a condition. If it returns true, a code block will run. Then the condition will be checked again and if it still returns true, the code block will run again. It repeats until the condition returns false.

**in below a flowchart of loop:**

 There are three common types of loops:
 1.  **For Loop:**  If you need to run code a specific number of times, use a . is the most common loop.) In a for loop, the condition is usually a counter which is used to tell how many times the loop should run.
   
 2. **While Loop:** If you do not know how many times the code should run, you can use a while loop. Here the condition can be something other than a counter, and the code will continue to loop for as long as the condition is true.
            

3. **do...while**: loop is very similar to the while loop, but has one key difference: it will always run the statements inside the curly braces at least once, even if the condition evaluates to false.

  ## Operatores ro Evaluate the condistions :

 - > <	less than

-  > \>greater than

- > <= less than or equal to

- > \>= greater than or equal to

- >   == equal to

- > !=	not equal to

- > ===	strict equal

- > !==	not strict equal


## Expressions:
There are three main expressetions in the condtions which are:


1. ### **&&:**
 LOGICAL AND This operator tests more than one condition. ((2 < 5) & (3 >- 2)) returns true If both expressions evaluate to true then the expression returns true. If just one of these returns false, then the expression will return false. 
 - true && true returns true 

 - true && false returns false

 - false & true returns false

 - false && false returns false

2. ### **||:**

 LOGICAL OR This operator tests at least one condition. ((2 < 5) || (2 < 1)) returns true If either expression evaluates to true, then the expression returns true. If both return false, then the expression will return false. 
 - true || true returns true 

 - true || false returns true 

 - false || true returns true 

 - false || false returns false

 3. ### **i:**
  LOGICAL NOT This operator takes a single Boolean value and inverts it. (T > 2)1 returns true This reverses the state of an expression. If it was false (without the ! before it) it would return true. If the statement was true, it would return false.

  -  Itrue returns false

  -  Ifalse returns true
