# FUNCTIONS, METHODS & OBJECTS 

## What is Function?

Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).

## How does functions work?

To create a function, you give it a name and then write the statements needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces. This is known as a function declaration.

* ### parameters and arguments:
 functions exchange information by means of parameters and arguments. 
     
- - **parameter** : declaration within the parentheses following the function name in a function declaration or definition; 
- -  **argument** refers to any expression within the parentheses of a function call.


* ### calling :
We say that a program or a section of code “calls” a function. This means that we want to execute the code in the function. A function may “return” a value. This means that the calling statement will receive some result from the function when the function execution is complete. 

* ### Return Value:
When you write a function  you expect it to provide you with an answer, the response is known as a return value.
