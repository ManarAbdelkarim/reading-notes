## How to use the Random Module in Python ?

The random module provides access to functions that support many operations. Perhaps the most important thing is that it allows you to generate random numbers.

## The Random module contains some very useful functions.

- Randint => if we wanted a random integer .

- Choice => Generate a random value from the sequence sequence.

- Random => If you want a larger number, you can multiply it.

## Why do we use Risk Analysis?
 In any software, using risk analysis at the beginning of a project highlights the potential problem areas.

The perspective of Risk Assessment

## Level of Risks:
- High: means the effect of the risk would be very high and non-tolerable. The company might face loss.

- Medium: it is tolerable but not desirable. The company may suffer financially but there is a limited risk.

- Low: it is tolerable. There lies little or no external exposure or no financial loss.

## Risk Identification:
- Business Risks: 

- Testing Risks

- Premature Release Risk

- Software Risk

## The perspective of Risk Assessment

- Effect – To assess risk by Effect. In case you identify a condition, event or action and try to determine its impact.

- Cause – To assess risk by Cause is opposite of by Effect. Initialize scanning the problem and reach to the point that could be the most probable reason behind that.

- Likelihood – To assess risk by Likelihood is to say that there is a probability that a requirement won’t be satisfied.

## How to perform Risk Analysis?

1. Searching the risk

2.  Analyzing the impact of each individual risk

3.  Measures for the risk identified
