Git is the most popular version control system in the world. It is a version control system records that makes changes to our code over time in a special database called repository. We can look at our project history and see who has made what changes when and why and if we screw something up we can easily revert our project back to an earlier state without a version control system we'll have to constantly store copies of the entire project in various folders

## Some Usefull Git Command:

- ### Git status:

      command gives us all the necessary information
      
       about the current branch (current place in git repository).


- ### Git add:

      command Takes your files to the staging
      
       area(adding files to staging area)

- ### Git commit:

      is like setting a checkpoint in the development process which you
      
       can go back to later if needed(white changes to Git repository).
