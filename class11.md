CSS Setting height and width for images the height and width properties are used to set the height and width of an element.

The `height` and `width` properties do not include padding, borders, or margins. It sets the height/width of the area inside the padding, border, and margin of the element.

Specifying image sizes helps
pages to load more smoothly
because the HTML and CSS
code will often load before the
images, and telling the browser
how much space to leave for an
image allows it to render the rest
of the page without waiting for
the image to download.


```
img {
height: 200px;
width: 50%;
}
<html><img src='./img/teamAttack.jpg'</html>
```
<style>
img {
height: 300px;
width: 100%;
}</style>

<html><img src='./img/teamAttack.jpg'</html>

The <video\> and <audio\> elements allow us to embed video and audio into web pages. As we showed in Video and audio content, a typical implementation looks like this:
```
<video controls>
  <source src="rabbit320.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="rabbit320.webm" type="video/webm">
  <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is a <a href="rabbit320.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.</p>
</video>
```

<video controls>
  <source src="rabbit320.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="rabbit320.webm" type="video/webm">
  <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is a <a href="rabbit320.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.</p>
</video>

This creates a video player inside the browser.

**How to align images?**

.column {
float: left;
width: 33.33%;
padding: 5px;
}

.row::after {
content: "";
clear: both;
display: table;
}


**background-image**

The `background-image` property specifies an image to use as the background of an element. 
<br>
The background-image
property allows you to place
an image behind any HTML
element. This could be the entire
page or just part of the page. By
default, a background image will
repeat to fill the entire box.<br>
and you can control how many times
you want to repeat in the x direction 
or the y direction or none for not repeating 
once ,or you can assign background postion
Using CSS, it is possible to create
a link or button that changes to a
second style when a user moves
their mouse over it (known as a
rollover) and a third style when
they click on it.
<br> To reduce the number 
of images your browser has to
load, you can create image sprites.

**Repeating Images**

- repeat  
- repeat-x 
- repeat-y 
- no-repeat 


**Example**
body {
  background-image: url("./img/teamAttack.jpg");
  background-repeat: repeat-y;
}

**Add Responsiveness**

Optionally, you could add media queries to make the images stack on top of each other instead of floating next to each other, on a specific screen width.

## Summary

This is very helpful when you use the same sized
images on several pages of your site.

- Images can be aligned both horizontally and vertically
using CSS.
- You can use a background image behind the box
created by any element on a page.
- Background images can appear just once or be
repeated across the background of the box.
- You can create image rollover effects by moving the
background position of an image.

load, you can create image sprites.
