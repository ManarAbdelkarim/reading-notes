## What is a Script ?

A script is a series of instructions that a
computer can follow to achieve a goal. Scripts are made up of instructions a computer can follow step-by-step.

To approach writing a script, break down your goal into
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed
to complete that task (a flowchart can help).

    - You can specify a set of steps for
the browser to follow (like a recipe)

4. React to events triggered by the user or browser
