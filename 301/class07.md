REST provides a definition of a “resource”, which is what those things point to.

 A web page is a “representation” of a resource. Resources are just concepts. URLs--those things that you type into the browser

 Those URLs tell the browser that there's a concept somewhere. A browser can then go ask for a specific representation of the concept. Specifically, the browser asks for the web page representation of the concept.



## REST API:

and is often regarded as the language of Internet and is completely based on resources apart from this it's also a stateless
