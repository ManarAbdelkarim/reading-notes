## What Is Node.js?

What is node .js this definetion from stack over flow sums it up nicely .Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

but , “event-based”, “non-blocking”, “asynchronous I/O” — that’s quite a lot to digest in one go. So let’s approach this from a different angle and begin by focusing on the other detail that both descriptions mention — the V8 JavaScript engine.


## Node Is Built on Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine


**Node.js®** is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine, and it is an *event-based*, *non-blocking*, *asynchronous* I/O runtime that uses **Google’s V8 JavaScript engine** and **libuv library**.

- **The V8 engine** is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including:
  - Brave.
  - Opera.
  - Vivaldi.
  It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for **compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code** that your computer can execute.

The V8 engine is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi. When we say that Node is built on the V8 engine, we don’t mean that Node programs are executed in a browser. Rather, the creator of Node took the V8 engine and enhanced it with various features, such as a file system API, an HTTP library, and a number of operating system–related utility methods.

# where to use Node.js ?

Node js is suited for building applications that require some form of real-time interaction or collaboration, (ex example chat sites) and 
 apps such as CodeShare you can watch a document being edited live by someone else


#  Advantages Using of Node.js?

+ speed and scalability.

+ JavaScript is everywhere, and Node is a vast and expansive subject.

+ An often-touted advantage of using JavaScript on a web server is that your brain no longer needs to switch modes. You can do everything in the same language, which, as a developer, makes you more productive.

+  it speaks JSON. It is probably the most important data exchange format on the Web, and the lingua franca for interacting with object databases 

+ JavaScript is ubiquitous: most of us are familiar with JavaScript, or have used it at some point.
