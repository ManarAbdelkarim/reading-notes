### Client/server architecture
An HTML form on a web page is nothing more than a convenient user-friendly way to configure an HTTP request to send data to a server. This enables the user to provide information to be delivered in the HTTP request.


### SENDING FORM DATA
Form attributes:
1. `action = "url` : the data will be sent to the specified url / if none to the same page.The action attribute defines where the data gets sent. Its value must be a valid relative or absolute URL. If this attribute isn't provided, the data will be sent to the URL of the page containing the form â€” the current page. 
`<form action="/somewhere_else">`
2. `method = "GET"` : is the method used by the browser to ask the server to send back a given resource.
Example: `<form action="http://www.foo.com" method="GET">`

3. `method = "POST"` : It's the method the browser uses to talk to the server when asking for a response that takes into account the data provided in the body of the HTTP request
Example: `<form action="http://www.foo.com" method="POST">`
When the form is submitted using the POST method, you get no data appended to the URL.


### Form tag attributes:
- `action = "/path-to-url"`
- `method = "GET/POST"`
- `name = "formName"`
- `autocomplete = "on/off"`
- `target = "_blank" (new tab) / "_self" (current tab)`
- `enctype = "text/plain" (text input form) "multipart/form-data" (forms containing files)`
