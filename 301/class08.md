## What is SQL?
 SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database. And due to its simplicity, SQL databases provide safe and scalable storage for millions of websites and mobile applications.

## Relational databases
Before learning the SQL syntax, it's important to have a model for what a relational database actually is. A relational database represents a collection of related (two-dimensional) tables. Each of the tables are similar to an Excel spreadsheet, with a fixed number of named columns (the attributes or properties of the table) and any number of rows of data.

For example, if the Department of Motor Vehicles had a database, you might find a table containing all the known vehicles that people in the state are driving. This table might need to store the model name, type, number of wheels, and number of doors of each vehicle for example.

 In such a database, you might find additional related tables containing information such as a list of all registered drivers in the state, the types of driving licenses that can be granted, or even driving violations for each driver.


## Queries with constraints

In order to filter certain results from being returned, we need to use a WHERE clause in the query. The clause is applied to each row of data by checking specific column values to determine whether it should be included in the results or not.


## SELECT queries

To retrieve data from a SQL database, we need to write SELECT statements, which are often colloquially refered to as queries. A query in itself is just a statement which declares what data we are looking for, where to find it in the database, and optionally, how to transform it before it is returned. It has a specific syntax though.

 given a table of data, the most basic query we could write would be one that selects for a couple columns (properties) of the table with all the rows (instances).

<!-- `SELECT column, another_column, â€¦FROM mytable;` -->

The result of this query will be a two-dimensional set of rows and columns, effectively a copy of the table, but only with the columns that we requested.

If we want to retrieve absolutely all the columns of data from a table, we can then use the asterisk (*) shorthand in place of listing all the column names individually.

<!-- `SELECT * FROM mytable;` -->

This query, in particular, is really useful because it's a simple way to inspect a table by dumping all the data at once.

## DISTINCT

 convenient way to discard rows that have a duplicate column value.

## Ordering results

 most data in real databases are added in no particular column order. As a result, it can be difficult to read through and understand the results of a query as the size of a table increases to thousands or even millions rows.

## What is a Schema?

database schema is what describes the structure of each table, and the datatype that each column of the table can contain.
