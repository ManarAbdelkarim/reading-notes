# Growth Mindset and Fixed Mindset
A Growth Mindset can be reached by practicing and focusing on the way of thinking. people shuold Perseverance, gumption traps, and maintaining a growth mindset.Thinking as a grouth minset person will not make you grow only at work,  but also outside work. A growth mindset opens up more creativity and possibility. The paragraph below will describe how growth mindset and fixed mindset function and the difference between them in many aspects , and finally some examples of growth mindset thinking.

**Growth Mindset:**
A growth mindset believes that one’s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort,

**fixed mindset:**
 intelligence and talent are seen as fixed traits, suggesting that success comes from these inherent qualities alone,
 without the need for further development or effort.

 to  achieve goal "No pain ,No gain".

ignore the criticism and  view it as a burden 

## Examples of Growth midset thinking:

1.  if there is something I can't do , That only means I can't do it yet! like a sport or new skills  
2.   I should not take the critisim as a personal attack and get offended from my co-workerrs or anyone, 
but I should separate the words from the intent and understand that it's still not specifically about me and I should take 
advantage of it.
3.  I should always remember that it is not too late to learn something new or even make a big shift and take new challenges.
